# cs171_customer_churn_prediction
Official repo for the final project of CS171. We will be using the Telco customer churn: IBM dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a given customer will churn using Logistic Regression.  

Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression

Authors
- Nyi Wai Yan Tun

Description of Question and Research Topic
- For this project, we will be using Telco customer churn: IBM dataset from Kaggle. This dataset has about 7000 rows of data and 33 columns which ranges from detailed customer demographics to service infromation and billing information. The question for this project is to predict the likelihood of customer churn using customer's demographics and available member information. We will be using Logistic Regression to evaluate which customers are likely to churn or to stay. This project will leverage data and Machine Learning to tackle customer retention which is a common real world problem.

Data Collection
- Downloading Dataset from Kaggle
- Cleaning and Preprocessing to remove empty rows

Model Plan
- Will build and test a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn. This includes training the model and checking how well it performs using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Project Timeline
Week 1: Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing
Week 2: Exploratory data analysis and visualization
Week 3: Model building and evaluation
Week 4: Interpret results and finalize report
